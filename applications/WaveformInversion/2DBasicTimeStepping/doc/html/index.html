         <introduction>
            <p>This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This software release includes an parallel framework in Matlab for time-domain Gauss-Newton full-waveform inversion [1]. This
               application package is an extension of our previous work which is conducted in the frequency domain [2,3]. In this package,
               we only carried out Gauss-Newton FWI with randomized dimensionality reduction techniques. Our future work will be time domain
               FWI with modified Gauss-Newton techniques [2,3].
