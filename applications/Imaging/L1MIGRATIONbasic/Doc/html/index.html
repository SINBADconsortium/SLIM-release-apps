         <h1>Efficient least-squares imaging with sparsity promotion and compressive sensing</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This software release includes an parallel framework in Matlab for L1 migration [1,2], which based on the ideas from compressive-sensing
               and stochastic optimization, where the least-squares imaging result are computed from random subsets of the data via curvelet-domain
               sparsity-promotion. There are two different subset sampling strategies are considered in this package: randomized source encoding,
               and drawing sequential shots firing at random source locations from marine data with missing near and far offsets. In both
               cases, we obtain excellent inversion results compared to conventional methods at reduced computational costs. There is also
               a small example based on a small one- layer model which can allow users to test the algorithm in a short time
