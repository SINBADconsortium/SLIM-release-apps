            <p>This software provides an algorithm to perform least-squares RTM with sparsity promotion using the linearized Bregman method.
               By subsampling the sources in each iteration, the overall number of PDE solves lies in the range of a regular RTM image, making
               this method feasible for large-scale problems.
