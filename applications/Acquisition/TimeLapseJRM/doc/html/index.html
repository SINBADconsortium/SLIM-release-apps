         <introduction>
            <p>This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This package is an application for time-lapse data acquired with randomized sampling schemes, and a joint recovery method
               based on sparse inversion (via L1 minimization). In particular, we show the performance of the method for: (i) data with random
               missing shots, and (ii) data simulated for a time-jittered, blended marine acquisition.
