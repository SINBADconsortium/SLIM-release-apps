# Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion and Imaging
##  DESCRIPTION
 This is the code base for Wavefield reconstruction Inversion and Imaging. No scripts in these folders should be used on their own. The imaging application can be found in SLIM-release-apps / applications / Imaging / WRimaging / . The inversion application can be found in  SLIM-release-apps / applications / WaveformInversion / 2DWRI /. The codes are based on [1,2].
